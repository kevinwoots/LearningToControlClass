# Special Topics on Optimal Control and Learning — Fall 2025 (ISYE 8803 VAN)
*Georgia Institute of Technology – Fridays 2-4:45 pm ET*

**Designers:** Andrew Rosemberg & Michael Klamkin  
**Instructor:** Prof. Pascal Van Hentenryck

---

## Overview
This student-led course explores modern techniques for controlling — and learning to control — dynamical systems. Topics range from classical optimal control and numerical optimization to reinforcement learning, PDE-constrained optimization (finite-element methods, Neural DiffEq, PINNs, neural operators), and GPU-accelerated workflows.

## Prerequisites
* Solid linear-algebra background  
* Programming experience in Julia, Python, *or* MATLAB  
* Basic ODE familiarity  

## Grading
| Component | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Participation & paper critiques | **25 %** |
| In-class presentations | **50 %** |
| Projects | **25 %** |
